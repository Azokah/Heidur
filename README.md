### Small - Casual - RPG

#### Summary

   *In a place full of magic and mystery, where honor is everything, the evil is trying to destroy it all, and maybe you are the hero that people need. The gods will try your determination and courage, and maybe you will finally arrive at what seems to be the twisted end of the humanity. Will you be capable of prevent it?*

#### What is this about...
- *Survival:* The apocaliptic demons will not rest until what is left of the humanity is forever erased from this world.

- *RPG:* Develop tactics, aquire knowledge, learn new skills, forge new weapons, and do whatever it takes in order to stop the evil.

- *Casual:* The evil can be banished quicker than a cup of tea.

- *Coop:* Because it is more fun to kill the bad guys with your friends.
