monsturos (aleatorios). El objetivo de los jugadores es vencer al/los monstruo/s utilizando sus propias habilidades.

    
    Enemies ideas:
    
    The first is having a NPC stay out of the players sight and set up traps and move things around since the player would assume it's just the games programming.
        Works well with doll enemies as well since they can just stay still when the players in the room.

    Second is an invisible NPC that reacts to what the player interacts with and moves around the house opening and closing doors etc.

    third is a monster the player has to hide from however I've seen games like this already such as granny's house that was recently popular.

    Forth, which is similar to the last, is a NPC that hides in the walls and secret passages. Funnily enough i saw recently that was pretty rad with basically the same concept.
        The npc would trigger things in the rooms players are in as well as changing the layout of the area by moving walls and so on.
